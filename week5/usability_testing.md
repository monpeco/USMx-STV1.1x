#### Usability Testing

There are many different approaches and forms of usability testing however, the primary goal of the testing is to make sure that the product is usable from the view of the user and it interacts well with the end user. Therefore, usability testing is a typical black-box type of testing. For example, the testing includes the evaluation of the design of the product features placement on the screen/page, the ease of interaction and finding those features, color schemes, images and movements, which features are grouped together, and more. And unfortunately, one model does not fit all because depending who the end user will be based on skill, education, computer literacy, age and so forth, you may need to design your product differently. That is why ideally some of the usability testing should be done by a customer with the testers/developers observing the test.

Why observe? Because you can learn a lot about the ease of use by observing the typical user interacting with the system.  For example, you may give the user a scenario you want them to test and some questionnaire to answer once they complete that scenario.  And one of the questions may be how hard/easy it was for them to find some feature of the system that was part of the scenario. Well after they completed the scenario, the user may have answered that it was relatively easy for them to find the feature and yet you observed that they spent a long time just looking at the screen looking for it. Or maybe it was the opposite. The problem is that “ease of use” is very subjective and so why you definitely want to know the perception the user had of “ease” you also want some more objective data that you can observe.

It has been proven time and time again that having a wonderful product as far as features and functionality will not necessarily be accepted by the users unless it is also pleasant and easy to use. Yet, designing such product is often much harder than it seems because everyone has different definition of “easy” and “usable”. What makes it even harder, is that those who design software products are obviously the ones with the most skills and experience with the technology and so they are not the “typical” user of a system that may need to be used by anyone. In fact, there are whole disciplines called Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) dedicated to this area. The experts in these areas have knowledge and experience of what has been proven to work and not work for different audience targets and they can help with designing all the system’s interfaces.

So when is usability testing done? It starts in the design phase. The designer would design the interfaces with some mock up screenshots and have it reviewed and approved by others in the development organization (developers, testers, business manager, product owner, etc.) to include the above mentioned experts and ideally the customers/end-users. Then there would be usability scenarios creative sometimes with the interactive mock-ups or a prototype that can be used for testing the interfaces. The mock-ups/prototype for example would allow clicking, adding input, moving between screens or pages and in general would allow getting a feel of how the product would work as far as flow and interaction and how easy it is to learn the software’s functionality. This early test is critical to make sure that the design is done right otherwise it could be very costly or impossible to change later in the cycle. Then once the functionality is completed and stable, the actual software could be usability tested using the same scenarios (with more details) to verify that the interfaces are working as designed and are comfortable and intuitive to the user.  This may be done as part of system test by assigned testers or by user interface expert. Again it is very useful to have actual users do some of the testing.

Usability testing includes not just the actual testing but also the collection and analysis of the data to improve the quality of the interfaces and the software. When successful, it will find the design issues and defects that often can be missed by the technical people before the product is released to the users. Test materials may include:

·         checklist – items to test for based on requirements and standard ease-of-use criteria

·         survey – questionnaires with a rating (e.g. 1-10 or 1-5) for different aspects of the interaction and usability of the software

·         Scenarios – testing tasks or sequence of tasks to test the typical interaction of user with the software

When writing a usability testing scenario, there are a number of things that should be considered such as who is the typical user, why is the user using the software, and what exactly is the user trying to accomplish. Then one has to consider what type of scenario to write such as:

·         Goal or task – tells test user what they need to do but without giving them steps to do it; checking that user can figure out how to do it easily

·         Detailed scenario – includes user characteristics and details of scenario; used by developers to make sure that content, functionality, and system behavior meets that users’ needs; tester checks that user interface works as expected based on that scenario

·         Full scale task scenario – includes steps to accomplish the task from user’s point of view; often scenario is part of documentation and the steps are tested for usability

The number of tasks given to the users or external testers should be limited to most critical ones to be tested (i.e. the most common scenarios) and the tasks/scenarios should be realistic – real-life -scenarios that users will do. The materials should avoid providing clues or using developer/tester language. They should be written in the user language and from his point of view and perspective of why and what for the person is using the system. So for example if the system is a medical billing system, it should be written from the view of a medical biller, nurse, and/or a receptionist at a doctor’s office who needs to interact with the system.

Some other criteria for successful usability testing include:

·         The person testing has to be an actual user or someone not already intimately familiar with the internals of the product and viewing the system as a user and ideally with similar background and skill level of an actual user

·         The testing should include a number of standard tasks that a user would do with emphases on the interface and not the functionality

·         Ideally you want 4-5 people to conduct the same tasks. When one person has trouble with something or has no trouble, it could be their subjective experience but with 4-5 people experiencing the same issue or not, gives you more reliable and objective data.

·         During the testing you may want to have an impartial person working with the customers/testers (as opposed to developers) to avoid adding stress to the experience

·         At the end of the testing, there should be report of improvements for the design

·         Tasks need to be measurable where success or failure can be determined and to what degree

·         Results of the test should give as much detail as possible. For example if loading is slow, it should state how many seconds it took.

 

Nowadays many products are used through the web interfaces or are used as mobile device applications. As a result, there are more commonalities between products and more knowledge of what kind of interfaces are liked or disliked by the general end users. Therefore, developers/testers may have developed processes on conducting in-house usability to check for those known issues and to test that the product meets overall usability criteria for certain categories such as:

·         Page Layout and Visual Design -  checks that the pages are designed well as far as colors, fonts, images, sizes, type of content, and controls; For example: the pages are not too busy; first screen has the most important categories, links, or menus; fonts and colors are readable and consistent across system;  there are not too many attention-getting features such as animation  and larger/bolder text

·         Navigation scenarios – check if a user can navigate the system with ease; For example:  user can move among pages/menus easily and find them easily; navigation choices are prioritized correctly with most important on top;  there is a site map for web systems; user can easily tell where he is in the site/application;  links are uniformed across system;  user can go back to previous site/menu

·         Search usability – checks that search feature exists and has appropriate functionality; For example: there is search ability for the system if appropriate (web system should always have);  search results are relevant with best ordered on top;  the length of search box is appropriate;  result page is formatted with most important information; the search is easy to use and may have some filtering

·         Use of Images – checks that images are used to add effectiveness to the page/site and do not degrade the experience; For example:  images are useful and relevant to the content;  image has good quality, composition, size, exposure, etc.; images send the correct message(s); images are not just fillers; images have a purpose and guide toward the information

·         Performance – checks the performance of the system relative to speed; For example: loading of pages is not too slow; speed of  loading of tables and images is appropriate; clicking on links does not take long time to go to the next page/screen/window

·         Accessibility and Disability – checks that system is accessible to people with disabilities to include visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive and neurological disabilities, age, etc.;  For example:  color and contrast is appropriate for users with low vision and color blindness;  fonts are not too small;  there are visual alternatives to sound and vice versa;  screen reader can be used; there are no unnecessary  sounds such as background music; motion is used to guide and not distracting; content that moves, scrolls, and blinks can be disabled, paused, or hidden

#### Alpha and Beta testing

These types of tests are usually done during system deployment stage either after or as part of acceptance testing.  Alpha testing is executed first and is normally done within development organization by either independent team such as a vendor test team or a representative group of end users. Beta testing is then usually done by the end users at their own site on their own testing systems.

##### Alpha Testing
The testing tries to simulate as close as possible the real operations of end users to find defects before the code is released to key customers doing the beta test or to the general population. Sometimes in-house developers/testers will conduct this testing but they should not be the ones who developed or tested the code previously.

The emphasis is to make sure that the beta testers will not find any major problems and that the majority of the most common tasks and scenarios work well.

All major defects which are found at this time are fixed although as always there is priority, impact, and cost assessment done to determine what to fix and when. Minor design changes may still be done if needed although any redesign is avoided if possible.

##### Beta Testing
For this testing, the software is sent to the customers (end users) who try out the product earlier in exchange for providing feedback to the development.  The customers are given some specific amount of time to complete their testing and provide feedback. They usually install and run the types of tasks and workloads that they expect to use in their production system.

The product needs to be already well tested and stable so that the customers have a positive experience and not waste their time. During this time there is usually a liaison that communicates with the customers regularly and collects data and there is a dedicated team of developers on call to assist the beta customers and fix the defects quickly so there is no delay in the testing.

This type of testing is important because not only are the customers testing on real systems that they will use with the software but they provide real users’ perspective that often finds undiscovered flaws and issues in the software. This improves the overall quality of the product before it becomes widely available to everyone else.

There are two types of beta testing: open or closed. In the closed type of beta testing the development company contacts a selected group of customers and asks them to be the beta testers. This type of testing is usually done for larger and more complicated products. The company then works closely with those customers during the test.

In an open beta test the software is available upon request and to anyone who may be interested. Often these products can be downloaded online and tried out and are smaller and less complex. The beta testers will have a forum or some way of reporting errors and to provide suggestions of improvement.

#### Act-like-a-user testing

It is common knowledge that developers and testers working on a product are not like their own typical users. They are more versed in the technology and have above average computer skills and have tendency to concentrate on features as opposed to clean functionality. For example, it is a common mistake for a developer to get excited about having different ways of doing something but normally the end user only wants a single way that works well. The end users are not interested in the technology itself the way the developer is. The technology is there to help them do their job better and easier. Because of this, the user interfaces and the flow of functionality may be biased and inefficient.

So to be a good tester and designer, one has to “act-like-a-user”.  That requires you understand who your user will be, their computer skill level, education, age, etc. and above all else how they plan to use the product. You have to concentrate on the tasks that a user will want and need to do and how they will do it.

Even products geared toward other developers and testers fall short on their usability because again the developers working on these products often fail to consider how their customers will use them. After all, a developer who is given a tool for testing is not interested in the tool itself but how that tool will help him test the code he/she is working on. So they need to learn and understand the tool quickly to be productive in their job.

So again, ideally you want to have real customers involved in your design and testing to help you understand the target audience and your end users.  Then you have to put yourself in their shoes when testing and always concentrate on easy and straight forward interfaces with as few steps as possible to accomplish the needed tasks.

#### Examples

So let’s look some more at usability testing. In the lecture we talked about three basic types of scenarios you can have: (a) goal or task, (b) detailed scenario, or (c) full scale scenario. Now we will look at the example of each.

Imagine that you are part of a development team working on a new website for IHOP Company (www.ihop.com), which is a diner type restaurant chain. Imagine that IHOP does not have a web page yet and this is their first web presence and your team needs to make sure that the user interface is user friendly, easy to use and learn, and works correctly. So your customer is the IHOP Company but your end users will be the customers of IHOP.

Here are some example scenarios that you may create for the usability testing that would be executed by an end-user tester or a tester acting as a user:

##### Goal or task

This type of scenario provides task descriptions without steps. It should be specific and give the tester as much information as needed for what to find without telling them how to do it and without using terminology or language that helps them with navigation.

Task: Find IHOP restaurant in Chicago IL that is close to current location (zip code 60605) and directions to get there

 

##### Detailed scenario

This type of scenario describes the user characteristics that the user interface should be designed for. It also provides more details in the scenario then the task scenario.

Scenario: It was a busy day for a young family with three children and the parents decided they want to go out to eat for late lunch. They are thinking of IHOP restaurant but they are new to Chicago, IL area as they just moved here last month when the father received a new job as an accountant. They need to find the directions quickly because the kids are already getting restless. After dinner they want to check out the Shedd Aquarium at 1200 S. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605.

 

##### Full Scale Scenario

This type of scenario has the exact steps to accomplish the task that need to be followed and tested.

Find IHOP restaurant in Chicago IL that is close to Shedd Aquarium at 1200 S. Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60605 and the directions to get there.

1.       From www.ihop.com Home page click on Locations link location on the right side IHOP logo at the top of the screen.

2.       Type in the Chicago, IL 60605 in search field and select United States for the country

3.       Click search image on the right side of Unites States selection

4.       Check that 5 locations are displayed and ordered by the least distance to the zip code provided in the search

5.       Click on the number 1 location icon on the map

6.       Click on Get Directions link on left side of the screen below the address

Regardless which scenario is actually performed above, the end result should be the same with the “tester”, regardless if end user or tester, finding the correct location and the directions how to get there. In addition, for the first two types of scenarios, the person testing would either be observed or would document what they did and what trouble they had if any to find the information.

#### Instructions

##### Mission:

You have been asked to develop a usability checklist for your team and then to conduct a usability testing of a web site.

##### Objectives:

The goal of this project is for you to research and practice usability testing.  Specifically, you will:

1.         Design checklist of 18-24 items to test related to usability that could be used to test any web page. The items should be the most important things to check for that category and be appropriate for that category.

2.         Perform the usability test using your checklist, analyzing how well the web site performs for each item, then providing summary and conclusion for each category and then an overall summary and conclusion for the whole usability test effort

##### Web site

You will test the home page of Harold Washington Library Center for some of the functionality. Given how much functionality there is at most websites, you want to limit how much you do for this particular exercise. The URL is: https://www.chipublib.org/locations/15/

##### Exercise Steps

You will complete this exercise in two parts using the provided exercise template, as follows:

##### Part A

1.                  Review this week’s materials and research usability testing goals, techniques, best practices, etc. online. Online resources are listed below

2.                  Create a usability test checklist based on what you find during your research.

3.                  Checklist should use the provided categories in the template: Page Layout and Visual Design, Navigation, Site Search Capability, Use of Images, Performance (e.g. loading of pages), Accessibility and Disability

4.                  The checklist should have the most important items (3-5) to test for each category

5.                  Check the solutions document to self-assess how well you did. The actual information will be different but will give you an idea of the kind of items to check for each category

##### Part B

1.                  Use your usability checklist to test the web site and document results for each item from the checklist

2.                  For each category, summarize your findings and provide conclusions on how well the web site and its pages performed for that category

3.                  After you complete testing all the categories and their items, summarize your overall findings and provide conclusions. You should include your overall rating (excellent, good, bad, horrible) of the user usability experience based on your testing with explanation of why you rated the website that way. You should also provide a summary of the improvements that are needed along with their overall severity and importance.

4.                  Check the solutions document to self-assess how well you did. The actual assessment will be different then what you may have done but it will give you an idea what is documented and how
