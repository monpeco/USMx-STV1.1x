#### Introduction

It is a well-known fact in software industry that document and code reviews/inspections are extremely helpful in finding defects and issues. In fact, some defects and issues may only be found through this manual task (as opposed to testing) or they can be found a lot easier. That is why typically code review is done after unit test but before any function test to quickly find the more obvious problems in the code. Some typical issues found this way include:

·         Lack of or incorrect comments

·         Duplicate code

·         Overly complex or fancy code that is hard to maintain

·         Parts of algorithm that cannot be tested directly especially error paths

·         Obvious defects due to misunderstanding of requirements or inexperience with technology

·         Coding errors
